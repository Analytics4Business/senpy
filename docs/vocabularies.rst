Vocabularies and model
======================

The model used in Senpy is based on the following vocabularies:

* Marl, a vocabulary designed to annotate and describe subjetive opinions expressed on the web or in information systems.
* Onyx, which is built one the same principles as Marl to annotate and describe emotions, and provides interoperability with Emotion Markup Language.
* NIF 2.0, which defines a semantic format and APO for improving interoperability among natural language processing services
