SoMeDi exploits senpy's interoperability of services in their customizable data enrichment and NLP workflows.

TRIVALENT

`TRIVALENT <https://trivalent-project.eu/>`_ is an EU funded project which aims to a better understanding of root causes of the phenomenon of violent radicalisation in Europe in order to develop appropriate countermeasures, ranging from early detection methodologies to techniques of counter-narrative.

In addition to sentiment and emotion analysis services, trivalent provides other types of senpy services such as radicalism and writing style analysis.
